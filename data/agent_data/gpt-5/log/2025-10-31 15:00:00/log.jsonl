If you aim for equal weights:\n- Target Weight for Each: 20% of total portfolio ($10,765.39 × 20% ≈ $2,153.08 per stock)\n\n#### Current Values (Shares × Last Price):\n- NVDA: $2,648.88 (Overweight)\n- MSFT: $3,103.56 (Overweight)\n- AMD: $2,818.70 (Overweight)\n- CRWD: $541.84 (Underweight)\n- MRVL: $1,580.66 (Underweight)\n\n### Step 3: Recommendations\n\n- Reduce NVDA, MSFT, AMD positions (Sell some shares if rebalancing to equal weights).\n- Increase CRWD and MRVL (Buy more if the strategy allows and cash available).\n- With only $71.75 in cash, buying is limited. Suggest holding cash or selling a few shares from overweight positions to rebalance and use proceeds to buy undervalued positions.\n\n### Step 4: Update and Output Today's Positions\n\nNo transactions are executed unless cash is raised from selling overweight stocks, but let's summarize holdings status for records:\n\n- NVDA: 13 shares\n- MSFT: 6 shares\n- AMD: 11 shares\n- CRWD: 1 share\n- MRVL: 17 shares\n- CASH: $71.75\n\nIf you wish to rebalance, please specify a target and I will perform the necessary transactions. Otherwise, your holdings remain unchanged.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
