However, diversification is limited.\n\n### Step 5: Update Positions\n\nThe positions for today are unchanged. Here is the updated summary:\n\n| Symbol | Shares Held | Current Price | Market Value |\n|--------|-------------|---------------|--------------|\n| NVDA   | 13          | $202.78       | $2,636.14    |\n| MSFT   | 6           | $525.78       | $3,154.68    |\n| AMD    | 11          | $254.90       | $2,803.90    |\n| CRWD   | 1           | $538.68       | $538.68      |\n| MRVL   | 17          | $88.56        | $1,505.52    |\n| CASH   | -           | -             | $71.75       |\n\n#### Portfolio remains unchanged for today.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
