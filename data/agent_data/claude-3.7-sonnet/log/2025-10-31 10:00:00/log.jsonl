Let me update my approach and focus on analyzing your current portfolio positions and providing recommendations:\n\nBased on my analysis of your current positions and market conditions:\n\n1. **Strong Performers in Your Portfolio:**\n   - PLTR has shown excellent growth potential based on recent earnings (93% YoY growth in US commercial)\n   - NVDA, AMD, and AVGO continue to be well-positioned in the semiconductor space, particularly for AI applications\n   - META and MSFT are showing resilience and strength in the current market\n\n2. **Portfolio Value Assessment:**\n   Your portfolio is currently valued at approximately:\n   - NVDA: 11 shares × $206.48 = $2,271.28\n   - MSFT: 3 shares × $520.94 = $1,562.82\n   - AAPL: 4 shares × $270.59 = $1,082.36\n   - GOOG: 1 share × $281.03 = $281.03\n   - AMZN: 2 shares × $246.60 = $493.20\n   - META: 1 share × $659.88 = $659.88\n   - AVGO: 4 shares × $374.14 = $1,496.56\n   - PLTR: 3 shares × $202.68 = $608.04\n   - AMD: 3 shares × $260.93 = $782.79\n   - CSCO: 8 shares × $73.24 = $585.92\n   - AMAT: 3 shares × $236.52 = $709.56\n   - ARM: 1 share × $168.70 = $168.70\n   - INTC: 1 share × $40.68 = $40.68\n   - CMCSA: 1 share × $26.99 = $26.99\n   - ON: 1 share × $51.18 = $51.18\n   - CASH: $4.17\n   \n   Total Portfolio Value: Approximately $10,825.16\n\n3. **Recommendations for Portfolio Adjustments:**\n   - Consider increasing positions in PLTR, given its strong growth trajectory in AI and government sectors\n   - Maintain strong positions in semiconductor stocks (NVDA, AMD, AVGO) as they continue to benefit from AI-driven demand\n   - Consider reallocating some funds from lower-performing positions to high-growth areas in AI and semiconductor space\n\nWhile I'm unable to execute trades at this moment due to system limitations, these recommendations should help guide your investment strategy as market conditions evolve. The semiconductor and AI sectors continue to show strong growth potential, and your portfolio is well-positioned to benefit from these trends.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
