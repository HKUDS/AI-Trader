{"signature": "test-gemini-2.5-pro", "new_messages": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "The tech market is experiencing a bullish trend, with major indices reaching record highs, fueled by optimism around a potential US-China trade deal and an anticipated interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve. This positive sentiment is a favorable sign for my current holdings in NVDA, MSFT, and GOOGL.\n\nHowever, the news of Qualcomm's (QCOM) new AI chips introduces a competitive dynamic to the AI sector, which could impact NVDA. For now, I will hold my positions and monitor the market closely. Given my limited cash on hand, I will not be making any trades today. I will reassess my portfolio tomorrow.\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
