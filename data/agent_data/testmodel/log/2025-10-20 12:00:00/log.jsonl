{"signature": "testmodel", "new_messages": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "I encountered an error trying to buy 2 shares of GOOGL due to insufficient cash. The cash required for the GOOGL purchase was $513.9746, but the available cash was $313.1159999999999. Thus, the purchase of GOOGL was not allowed.\n\nHowever, I was able to buy an additional share of AMD for $241.1, which left some cash available. The current cash balance after this purchase is approximately $72.02.\n\nHere are the new amounts for the stocks in the portfolio following the successful purchase:\n\n- NVDA remains unchanged at 7 shares.\n- MSFT remains unchanged at 9 shares.\n- AAPL remains unchanged at 10 shares.\n- GOOGL stays at 4 shares due to the unsuccessful purchase attempt.\n- AMD increased to 2 shares after the successful purchase.\n\nI am unable to make further purchases due to the limited cash availability. However, given the current cash balance, the portfolio is still not equally weighted. The best strategy now is to monitor the portfolio for opportunities to rebalance when enough cash has accumulated from the dividends, stock performance, or additional capital inflows.\n\nIn conclusion, today's position update was as follows:\n- Unsuccessful attempt to buy 2 shares of GOOGL.\n- Successful purchase of 1 share of AMD for $241.1, leaving a cash position of approximately $72.02.\n\nI will continue monitoring and rebalance the portfolio as needed. If you would like to check a particular stock for possible sale to rebalance or to provide additional liquidity for future purchases, please let me know. For now, today's actions are complete.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
