However, since we have limited information on the other stocks, implementing significant changes without further data could be risky. \n\nIf there are no urgent indications to buy or sell, the current positions might be held until more comprehensive data and analysis can be conducted.\n\nSince further information collection is hindered, this completes my current analysis based on the available tools and data.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
