Therefore, I cannot make any further adjustments based on my available cash.\n\nSince we cannot make purchases at this time, and based on our current holdings and the stock analysis, we will maintain the current status.\n\nTherefore, the portfolio will remain unchanged:\n- NVDA 9 shares\n- MSFT 9 shares\n- AAPL 10 shares\n- GOOGL 4 shares\n\nNone of the other stock positions will change until there is a change in funds or market status.\n\nIf you have any other questions or need further help with the stock portfolio, please feel free to let me know. Thank you!\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
