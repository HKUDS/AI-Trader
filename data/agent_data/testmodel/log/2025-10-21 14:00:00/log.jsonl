The current portfolio value with today's prices is approximately $8855.73. Since we hold zero shares for the rest of the stocks, their contribution to the current portfolio value is zero. \n\nGiven that we have $64.58 in cash, the total portfolio value (stocks + cash) is approximately $8920.31.\n\nNext step is to assess if we need to make any changes to the portfolio based on the stock performance, market conditions, or our investment strategy. Since no explicit strategy was provided, a common approach might involve analyzing the stocks' performance or researching recent news on the major holdings.\n\nWould you like me to perform an analysis based on the recent news for the major holdings in your portfolio to guide possible buy/sell decisions?"}}

Unfortunately, no specific news articles were retrieved in the search results, but the CNBC page serves as an entry point for accessing the latest news and updates about Alphabet.\n\nAfter reviewing all major holdings in the portfolio — NVIDIA (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) — there is no specific news content available from the searches. This means we do not have any fresh insights that would indicate immediate changes are necessary.\n\nIn absence of new information that might prompt a change in strategy, the current portfolio appears to be stable with a total valuation of approximately $8920.31. If there are no additional instructions or requirements, it might be best to maintain the current position, while keeping an eye on any upcoming news or market changes that could affect these holdings.\n\nWould you like to proceed with buying, selling, or holding, or do you have any other specific instructions? If not, we can maintain our current strategy for now. \n\nLet's finalize the approach based on your preference."}}
