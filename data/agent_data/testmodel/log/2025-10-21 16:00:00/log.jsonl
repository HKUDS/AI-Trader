{"signature": "testmodel", "new_messages": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "Today, I sold all 5 shares of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) for a total of 1190.35 USD based on yesterday's closing price. This brought my cash position to $1254.8159. \n\nI attempted to gather information about Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), and Alphabet (GOOGL), but unfortunately, today's data (2025-10-21) wasn't available for these stocks. The search for additional information on these stocks yielded no results. Therefore, I couldn't make further position adjustments today.\n\nThe current portfolio positions are as follows:\n- NVDA: 6 shares\n- MSFT: 7 shares\n- AAPL: 11 shares\n- GOOGL: 5 shares\n\nFor your reference, the cash held yesterday was 64.58099999999985 USD, which combined with the stock valuations resulted in a total portfolio value of 10109.671 USD.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
