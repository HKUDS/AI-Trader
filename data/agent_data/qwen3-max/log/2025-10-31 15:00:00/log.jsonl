This might be due to the system expecting a different format or there being a data issue.\n\nGiven that I cannot execute trades due to the symbol recognition error, and I have analyzed the current portfolio composition thoroughly, I should conclude my analysis.\n\nMy analysis shows:\n- Total portfolio value: $10,298.32\n- Heavy concentration in semiconductors (68% in NVDA, AMD, MU)\n- Low cash position (1.06%)\n- Diversification needed to reduce sector risk\n\nHowever, due to the trading system limitations, I cannot execute any rebalancing trades at this time.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
