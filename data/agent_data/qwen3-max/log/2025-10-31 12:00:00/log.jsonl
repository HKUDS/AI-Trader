Based on the position data, the symbol is listed as 'NVDA', so that should be correct. Let me try another approach.\n\nActually, let me reconsider my strategy. Since I'm having tool issues and don't have clear market direction signals, maintaining the current positions might be the most prudent approach for now.\n\nLooking at the portfolio again:\n- We have strong positions in leading tech companies\n- The cash position is very low at ~1%, which limits flexibility\n- However, without clear market signals indicating a need to rebalance, making changes could introduce unnecessary transaction costs\n\nGiven the lack of clear market information and the current strong positions in market-leading companies, I'll maintain the current portfolio allocation.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
