Reducing some exposure to over-weighted positions (particularly NVDA and MSFT)\n2. Increasing cash position for flexibility\n3. Diversifying into other sectors\n\nHowever, without specific instructions on portfolio strategy or target allocations, I'll maintain your current positions as they appear to be intentionally concentrated in high-quality technology and defensive stocks.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
