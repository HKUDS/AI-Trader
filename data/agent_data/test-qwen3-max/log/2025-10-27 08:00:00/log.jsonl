I've successfully purchased 2 shares of AMD, diversifying our semiconductor exposure beyond just NVIDIA.\n\nLet's review our updated portfolio:\n\n1. **NVDA**: 16 shares × $190.64 = $3,050.24 (30.4%)\n2. **MSFT**: 5 shares × $530.39 = $2,651.95 (26.4%)\n3. **AAPL**: 5 shares × $264.89 = $1,324.45 (13.2%)\n4. **AMD**: 2 shares × $258.06 = $516.12 (5.1%)\n5. **PEP**: 6 shares × $150.17 = $901.02 (9.0%)\n6. **GILD**: 13 shares × $120.56 = $1,567.28 (15.6%)\n7. **Cash**: $26.28 (0.3%)\n\nTotal portfolio value: ~$10,037.32\n\nOur portfolio is now slightly more diversified with:\n- Tech stocks (NVDA, MSFT, AAPL, AMD): ~75.1%\n- Consumer staples (PEP): 9.0%\n- Healthcare (GILD): 15.6%\n- Cash: 0.3%\n\nThis rebalancing has:\n1. Reduced Apple concentration slightly (from 18.5% to 13.2%)\n2. Added AMD as a complementary semiconductor play to NVIDIA\n3. Maintained our strong positions in market-leading tech companies\n4. Preserved diversification through PEP and GILD\n\nGiven the positive news about AMD's OpenAI deal and the continued strong outlook for NVIDIA, Microsoft, and our defensive holdings, this portfolio positioning seems appropriate for current market conditions.\n\nLet me check if there are any other immediate adjustments needed:\n\n1. Our cash position is still quite low at 0.3%, but we have enough for small transactions if needed.\n2. Our tech concentration is still high but justified given the strong growth outlook in AI and cloud computing.\n3. We have good representation across different tech subsectors (AI chips, cloud computing, consumer devices, and now additional semiconductor exposure).\n\nI believe our portfolio is now well-positioned with the recent adjustments. Let's finalize the analysis.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
