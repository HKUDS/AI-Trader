The market shows a rebound today with tech stocks performing well. \n\nBased on the market conditions and portfolio concentration, I recommend:\n1. Consider diversifying by reducing some tech exposure\n2. Potentially add positions in defensive sectors or emerging opportunities\n3. Maintain some cash for flexibility\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
