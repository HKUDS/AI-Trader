Here's what I've done:\n\n**Portfolio Analysis Summary:**\n\n**Current Portfolio Value:** $10,141.13\n**Cash Position:** $179.00\n\n**Transactions Executed:**\n1. Sold 2 shares of NVDA at $183.96 each - This was due to concerns about recent insider selling activity and volatility in the semiconductor sector\n2. Sold 1 share of AVGO at $353.63 each - Also based on insider selling concerns\n3. Bought 3 shares of PEP at $151.53 each - Added defensive consumer staples exposure\n4. Bought 5 shares of KHC at $25.45 each - Added undervalued defensive consumer staples\n\n**Portfolio Changes:**\n- NVDA: Reduced from 10 to 8 shares (16.7% reduction)\n- AVGO: Reduced from 5 to 4 shares (20% reduction)  \n- Added PEP: 3 shares (new position)\n- Added KHC: 5 shares (new position)\n\n**Strategy Rationale:**\nI adjusted the portfolio to reduce exposure to semiconductor stocks showing insider selling activity (NVDA and AVGO) while adding defensive consumer staples (PEP and KHC) to provide stability. The Morningstar research indicated KHC as an undervalued defensive stock, making it attractive for portfolio diversification.\n\nThe portfolio maintains strong positions in technology leaders (MSFT, AAPL, GOOGL, AMZN, ARM) while adding defensive characteristics through consumer staples investments.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
