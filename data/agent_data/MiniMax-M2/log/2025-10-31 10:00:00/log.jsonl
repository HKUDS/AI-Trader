This is concerning since my portfolio is heavily concentrated in technology stocks (about 85% of holdings), particularly in NVDA, MSFT, AAPL, AMZN, and INTC.\n\nI searched for NVIDIA-specific information and found that the company reported strong fiscal 2025 results with revenue of $130.5 billion (up 114% year-over-year) and strong earnings per share. This suggests NVIDIA remains fundamentally strong despite the recent market selloff in tech stocks.\n\nLet me think about potential actions:\n\n1. Should I reduce my tech exposure? The portfolio is heavily weighted toward technology, which increases risk during a tech downturn. However, selling now would crystallize any losses.\n\n2. Could I diversify into other sectors? I have some healthcare (AMGN) and consumer goods (PEP, CMCSA), but these represent only about 15% of my portfolio.\n\n3. Would it make sense to add more NVDA given its strong fundamentals? With only $41.93 in cash, I can afford very few shares at current prices.\n\nGiven these constraints and the market conditions, I believe the best strategy is to hold my current positions. I'm particularly interested in NVDA due to its strong fundamentals in AI and data center revenue, but I can't afford to add more shares with my limited cash.\n\nI'll monitor the situation throughout the day and may need to make adjustments later if the market continues to decline or if better opportunities arise. For now, I'll maintain my existing positions while keeping a close eye on the performance of my largest holdings like NVDA, MSFT, and AAPL.\n\nWait, I just realized that I need to make an actual trade or decision as part of my role as a trading assistant. Given my limited cash and the tech market pressure, I'll hold my positions for now. The most significant change I might consider is taking some profits from my largest position (NVDA) if it rebounds, which would give me more cash to diversify into other sectors later.\n\nActually, I don't need to take immediate action. My role is to analyze and recommend, not necessarily to trade every day. Given the strong fundamentals of my holdings, particularly NVDA, and the current market conditions, the prudent approach is to hold my positions and monitor for better rebalancing opportunities in the future.\n</think>\n\nBased on my analysis, I'll hold my current positions for today. Here's my assessment:\n\nMy portfolio is heavily weighted toward technology stocks (about 85% of holdings), which is risky given the current market downturn in tech. However, I have very limited cash ($41.93) to make meaningful adjustments or diversify into other sectors.\n\nKey holdings to monitor:\n1. NVDA (36.6% of portfolio) - Despite market pressure, NVIDIA reported strong fiscal 2025 results with 114% year-over-year revenue growth and solid fundamentals in AI/data center sectors.\n2. MSFT and AAPL - Both under pressure after earnings but remain fundamentally strong.\n3. AMZN - Also impacted by tech selloff but has diversified revenue streams.\n\nWith the limited information and cash available, I believe the best strategy is to maintain current positions and wait for a better rebalancing opportunity. I'll monitor throughout the day for any significant market moves that might create better entry or exit points.\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
