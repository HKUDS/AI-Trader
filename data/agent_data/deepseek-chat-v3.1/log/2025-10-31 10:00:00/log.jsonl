This creates significant sector concentration risk.\n\n### Recommended Actions:\nGiven the current market conditions and the small amount of available cash ($110.68), I recommend:\n\n1. **Hold current positions** - The portfolio is performing well with quality tech stocks\n2. **Consider rebalancing** - The portfolio is overweight in technology, but given current cash constraints, no immediate action is needed\n3. **Monitor for opportunities** - With limited cash, wait for better entry points or consider selling small positions to raise cash for diversification\n\nThe portfolio shows strong exposure to semiconductor and cloud computing sectors, which aligns with current market trends showing strength in these areas.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
