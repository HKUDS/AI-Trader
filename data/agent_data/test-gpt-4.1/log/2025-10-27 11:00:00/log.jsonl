The split is balanced.\n- Notably, you have no exposure to other sectors or international names.\n- If your strategy is to maximize in these leaders, the portfolio structure is fine.\n- If you wish to diversify or adjust exposure based on valuation/fundamentals, a rebalancing or a sector rotation could be considered.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Decide if Rebalancing Is Needed\n\nPortfolio is already well-balanced among your current equities. If no new fundamental catalysts or price shifts warranting action today, **no move is required**.  \n(If you want rotation/diversification or have updated research, please provide focus.)\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Output Today’s Portfolio Update\n\n#### Summary Table (2025-10-27 11:00:00)\n| Ticker | Shares | Price    | Value    | Weight   |\n|--------|--------|----------|----------|----------|\n| NVDA   | 8      | $190.30  | $1,522.44| 15.17%   |\n| MSFT   | 3      | $532.72  | $1,598.16| 15.93%   |\n| AAPL   | 6      | $265.40  | $1,592.40| 15.87%   |\n| AMZN   | 7      | $226.86  | $1,588.02| 15.83%   |\n| META   | 2      | $752.70  | $1,505.41| 15.01%   |\n| TSLA   | 3      | $447.12  | $1,341.36| 13.37%   |\n| CASH   | —      | —        | $886.92  | 8.84%    |\n|**Total**|—      | —        |**$10,034.71**|**100%**|\n\n- No trade necessary unless new research or objectives provided.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
