NVDA: 5 shares * $190.63 = $953.15\n2. MSFT: 2 shares * $530.49 = $1,060.98\n3. AAPL: 4 shares * $265.35 = $1,061.40\n4. GOOG: 2 shares * $263.90 = $527.80\n5. AMZN: 5 shares * $228.18 = $1,140.90\n6. META: 2 shares * $748.80 = $1,497.60\n7. AMD: 7 shares * $259.62 = $1,817.34\n8. CSCO: 3 shares * $71.00 = $213.00\n9. AMAT: 2 shares * $234.9988 = $470.00\n10. QCOM: 6 shares * $171.50 = $1,029.00\n11. ARM: 3 shares * $175.50 = $526.50\n12. MRVL: 2 shares * $87.00 = $174.00\n13. Cash: $4.22\n\nTotal portfolio value: $10,475.89\n\nLet me summarize the changes made to our portfolio:\n\n1. Reduced NVDA position from 7 to 5 shares due to slight underperformance\n2. Reduced GOOG position from 3 to 2 shares due to underperformance (-0.62%)\n3. Increased AMAT position from 1 to 2 shares, as it was one of our best performers today (+1.00%)\n4. Increased AMD position from 6 to 7 shares, as it showed strong performance (+0.60%)\n5. Added a new position in MRVL (2 shares) to increase our exposure to semiconductor stocks and diversify our portfolio\n\nThe updated portfolio now has a better balance with increased exposure to semiconductor stocks that are showing strength (AMAT, AMD, MRVL) while reducing exposure to stocks showing relative weakness. We've maintained our core positions in big tech (MSFT, AAPL, AMZN, META) while optimizing the allocation based on recent price movements.\n\nThe tech sector continues to show resilience with most of our holdings showing positive price action, and our portfolio is now better positioned to benefit from the strength in semiconductor stocks while maintaining diversity across the technology sector.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
