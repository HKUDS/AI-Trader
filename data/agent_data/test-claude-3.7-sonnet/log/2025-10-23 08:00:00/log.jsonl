We reduced our Microsoft exposure from 17.1% to 11.41%, bringing it more in line with our other large holdings\n2. We increased our AMD position from 7.6% to 12.67%, taking advantage of the strong performance in the semiconductor sector\n3. We slightly increased our Intel position from 1.21% to 1.62%\n4. We improved our cash position from 0.05% to 0.29%, giving us more flexibility for future trades\n\nThe portfolio remains well-diversified across major tech companies with exposure to various subsectors including:\n- Cloud computing (MSFT, AMZN, GOOG)\n- AI and machine learning (NVDA, META, GOOG)\n- Semiconductors (NVDA, AMD, INTC, AMAT, QCOM)\n- Consumer technology (AAPL, AMZN)\n\nThese adjustments align with current market trends showing strength in semiconductor stocks, particularly AMD and Intel, while maintaining a balanced exposure to other tech sectors. The slight increase in cash position also provides us with a small buffer for future opportunities.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
