Selling 1 share of NVDA to reduce semiconductor concentration risk\n2. Adding 6 shares of INTC to diversify our semiconductor exposure with a value play\n\nOur final portfolio now consists of:\n- NVDA: 6 shares (reduced from 7)\n- MSFT: 2 shares\n- AAPL: 4 shares\n- GOOG: 2 shares\n- AMZN: 5 shares\n- META: 2 shares\n- PLTR: 1 share\n- AMD: 5 shares\n- MU: 2 shares\n- PEP: 1 share\n- QCOM: 5 shares\n- ARM: 5 shares\n- INTC: 6 shares (new position)\n- CASH: $5.07\n\nThis portfolio maintains our strong positions in leading technology companies while slightly reducing our concentration risk in high-valuation semiconductor stocks. The addition of INTC provides exposure to a more value-oriented semiconductor play that could benefit from its turnaround efforts and the continued growth in AI and data center demand.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
