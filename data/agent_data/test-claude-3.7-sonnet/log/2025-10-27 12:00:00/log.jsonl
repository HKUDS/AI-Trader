NVIDIA, AMD, and ARM are all critical players in this ecosystem.\n\n- **Reduced exposure to underperformers**: Sold Intel, which has struggled to compete effectively in AI chips, along with Marvell, Applied Materials, and Cisco to free up capital.\n\n- **Added memory exposure**: Purchased Micron (MU) to gain exposure to the growing memory demand for AI applications.\n\n- **Added defensive component**: PepsiCo (PEP) adds a defensive consumer staple to balance our tech-heavy portfolio.\n\n### Current Portfolio Composition:\n- Core AI chip leaders: NVDA (7), AMD (6), ARM (5), QCOM (5)\n- Big Tech with AI infrastructure: MSFT (2), AAPL (4), GOOG (2), AMZN (5), META (2)\n- AI software/analytics: PLTR (1)\n- Memory: MU (1)\n- Consumer defensive: PEP (1)\n- Cash: $12.79\n\nThis updated portfolio positions us well to benefit from the continued growth in AI infrastructure while maintaining exposure to the broader tech ecosystem.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
