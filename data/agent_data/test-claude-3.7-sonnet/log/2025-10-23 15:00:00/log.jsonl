Sold 1 share of NVDA at $182.94 to reduce concentration and free up cash\n2. Added 2 shares of PEP (PepsiCo) at $151.25 per share for defensive consumer staples exposure\n3. Added 1 share of SBUX (Starbucks) at $85.675 for consumer discretionary exposure\n\n### Current Portfolio Allocation:\n- Technology: ~87.5% (NVDA, MSFT, AAPL, GOOG, AMZN, META, AMD, AMAT, QCOM)\n- Consumer Staples: ~3% (PEP)\n- Consumer Discretionary: ~0.85% (SBUX)\n- Cash: ~0.32% ($32.06)\n\n### Total Portfolio Value: $10,133.72\n\n### Strategic Reasoning:\n1. While maintaining a strong tech focus which has been performing well (with Apple and Microsoft reaching $4T market caps), we've introduced some diversification with consumer staples and discretionary stocks.\n2. PepsiCo offers defensive characteristics with steady revenue and dividends during market uncertainty.\n3. Starbucks provides exposure to consumer spending and recovery in consumer discretionary.\n4. The portfolio remains well-positioned for tech growth while having slightly improved diversification.\n\n### Future Considerations:\n1. Consider further diversification into healthcare, financials, or utilities if cash becomes available\n2. Monitor tech sector valuations for potential profit-taking opportunities\n3. Keep some cash available for potential market dips\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
