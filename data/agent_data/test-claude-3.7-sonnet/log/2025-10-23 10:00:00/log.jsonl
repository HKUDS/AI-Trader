We've maintained a strong focus on semiconductor stocks (NVDA, AMD, AMAT, QCOM, INTC), which now make up approximately 40% of the portfolio.\n2. Tech giants (MSFT, AAPL, GOOG, AMZN, META) represent about 51% of our holdings.\n3. We've added to our INTC position, taking advantage of its lower price point to increase our semiconductor exposure.\n4. We've eliminated our WBD position, which wasn't aligned with our core technology focus.\n5. The portfolio is now better positioned for the AI and technology growth that market reports indicate will continue through 2025.\n\nThis rebalancing strengthens our focus on the technology sector, particularly semiconductor companies that are critical to AI development, while maintaining diversification across different technology segments.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
