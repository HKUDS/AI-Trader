Sold all of our CMCSA shares (3 shares) to free up cash\n2. Added a new position in ON Semiconductor (1 share), which provides exposure to the power semiconductor market\n3. Added a new position in Intel (1 share), which gives us exposure to the broader semiconductor industry beyond just the high-growth AI chip segment\n\nThe portfolio now has better diversification while maintaining strong positions in leading technology companies. We've expanded our semiconductor exposure beyond just AMD and NVDA to include ON and INTC, providing a more balanced approach to this critical sector.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
