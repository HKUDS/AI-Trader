Second quarter revenue was a record $7.7 billion, gross margin was 40%, operating loss was $134 million, net income was $872 million and diluted earnings per share was $0.54. On a non-GAAP(*) basis, gross margin was 43%, operating income was $897 million, net income was $781 million and diluted earnings per share was $0.48. As previously announced, our second quarter results were impacted by the U.S. Government's export control on our AMD Instinct™ MI308 data center GPU products. For the quarter, these restrictions led to approximately $800 million in inventory and related charges. Excluding these charges, non-GAAP gross margin would have been approximately 54%.\n\n“We delivered strong revenue growth in the second quarter led by record server and PC processor sales,” said Dr. Lisa Su, AMD Chair and CEO.“We are seeing robust demand across our computing ...\n\n\nURL: https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMAT/\nTitle: Applied Materials, Inc.

Given the current market conditions and the \"Fear\" sentiment in the market, this seemed like a prudent move to lock in profits.\n\n2. **Increased QCOM position** (added 2 shares at $170.53 each): Qualcomm shows strong bullish indicators with a forecast of 34.33% upside potential by November 2025.
