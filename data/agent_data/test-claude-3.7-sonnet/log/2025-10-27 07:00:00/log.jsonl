Bought 1 additional share of QCOM for $170.62\n\nUpdated Portfolio:\n- NVDA: 7 shares (unchanged)\n- MSFT: 2 shares (unchanged)\n- AAPL: 4 shares (unchanged)\n- GOOG: 3 shares (unchanged)\n- AMZN: 5 shares (unchanged)\n- META: 2 shares (unchanged)\n- AMD: 6 shares (unchanged)\n- CSCO: 3 shares (reduced from 6)\n- PEP: 0 shares (reduced from 1)\n- AMAT: 1 share (unchanged)\n- QCOM: 6 shares (increased from 5)\n- ARM: 3 shares (increased from 2)\n- Cash: $27.67\n\nKey Portfolio Adjustments Rationale:\n1. Increased exposure to AI and semiconductor chips through ARM and QCOM\n2. Reduced exposure to more mature, slower-growth assets (CSCO and PEP)\n3. Maintained strong positions in major tech leaders (NVDA, MSFT, AAPL, GOOG, META)\n4. Optimized cash position by deploying most available funds\n\nNew Portfolio Valuation:\n- NVDA: 7 shares x $190.78 = $1,335.46\n- MSFT: 2 shares x $529.67 = $1,059.34\n- AAPL: 4 shares x $264.72 = $1,058.88\n- GOOG: 3 shares x $265.85 = $797.55\n- AMZN: 5 shares x $228.65 = $1,143.25\n- META: 2 shares x $747.80 = $1,495.60\n- AMD: 6 shares x $258.56 = $1,551.36\n- CSCO: 3 shares x $70.83 = $212.49\n- QCOM: 6 shares x $170.62 = $1,023.72\n- ARM: 3 shares x $175.33 = $525.99\n- AMAT: 1 share x $233.35 = $233.35\n- Cash: $27.67\n\nTotal Updated Portfolio Value: $10,464.66\n\nThe portfolio is now better positioned with increased exposure to high-growth AI and semiconductor companies while maintaining diversification across the tech sector. We've reduced exposure to slower-growth companies and optimized our allocation for potential future growth.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
