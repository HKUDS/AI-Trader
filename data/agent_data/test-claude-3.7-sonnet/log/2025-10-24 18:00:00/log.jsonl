Cash: $5.32\n3. Total Portfolio Value: ~$10,317.51\n\nLooking at your portfolio, I notice it's heavily weighted toward tech stocks, particularly the major tech companies like NVIDIA, Microsoft, Apple, Google, Amazon, and Meta. \n\nLet me check for any significant price movements or opportunities in the current market:\n\n1. META (Meta Platforms) is showing strong performance, currently at $738.58 per share\n2. MSFT (Microsoft) continues its strong performance at $524.25\n3. AMD (Advanced Micro Devices) is performing well at $253.58\n4. NVDA (NVIDIA) is at $186.59, still a core holding in your portfolio\n5. CSCO (Cisco) appears to be stable at $70.59\n\nGiven the limited cash available ($5.32), I don't recommend making any trades today as there isn't enough to acquire meaningful positions. Your portfolio is already well-diversified among major tech companies that have shown resilience and growth potential.\n\nLet me review your current positions:\n\n- NVIDIA (NVDA): 6 shares at $186.59 = $1,119.54\n- Microsoft (MSFT): 2 shares at $524.25 = $1,048.50\n- Apple (AAPL): 4 shares at $263.04 = $1,052.16\n- Google (GOOG): 3 shares at $260.71 = $782.13\n- Amazon (AMZN): 5 shares at $224.34 = $1,121.70\n- Meta (META): 2 shares at $738.58 = $1,477.16\n- AMD: 6 shares at $253.58 = $1,521.48\n- Cisco (CSCO): 10 shares at $70.59 = $705.90\n- Qualcomm (QCOM): 6 shares at $169.04 = $1,014.24\n- Other positions (PEP, AMAT, INTC, ON): $469.38 combined\n- Cash: $5.32\n\nYour portfolio is well-positioned with a good mix of established tech giants and semiconductor companies. With the limited cash available, I recommend holding your current positions and monitoring for future opportunities when more cash becomes available.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
