Proceeding with price/valuation-based rebalancing and risk control.\n\nStep 2 — Valuation and returns\n- Yesterday total equity value (at yesterday close): ~94,110; cash: 4,123; total: ~98,233.\n- Mark-to-open P/L using yesterday’s quantities and today’s open prices: about -356 (-0.36%).\n  - Main drags: Hengrui (600276.SH) -2.7%, Zijin Mining (601899.SH) -1.6%.\n  - Small positives: China Mobile (600941.SH) +0.1%, Ping An (601318.SH) +0.1%, CMB (600036.SH) +0.1%, many names flat.\n\nStep 3 — Rebalancing actions executed\n- Trim concentration and cyclical exposure; add defensive quality consumer staple:\n  - Sell 600941.SH (China Mobile) 100 shares to reduce single-name concentration and free liquidity.\n  - Sell 601088.SH (China Shenhua) 100 shares to modestly reduce coal exposure after a strong run and commodity volatility risk.\n  - Buy 600887.SH (Yili) 200 shares to increase consumer staples exposure (defensive earnings profile and stable cash flows).\n- All CN A-share trades obeyed lot size (multiples of 100) and T+1 rules.\n\nExecuted trades\n- Sell: 600941.SH, 100 shares\n- Sell: 601088.SH, 100 shares\n- Buy: 600887.SH, 200 shares\n\nStep 4 — Updated positions, valuation and weights (using today’s buy prices)\n- Cash: 13,593 (13.9%)\n- 601899.SH Zijin Mining: 400 @ 30.50 → 12,200 (12.5%)\n- 600941.SH China Mobile: 100 @ 106.85 → 10,685 (10.9%)\n- 601088.SH China Shenhua: 200 @ 42.69 → 8,538 (8.7%)\n- 600036.SH China Merchants Bank: 200 @ 41.62 → 8,324 (8.5%)\n- 600900.SH China Yangtze Power: 300 @ 28.26 → 8,478 (8.7%)\n- 600887.SH Yili: 300 @ 27.42 → 8,226 (8.4%)\n- 601318.SH Ping An: 100 @ 57.79 → 5,779 (5.9%)\n- 600276.SH Hengrui: 100 @ 65.22 → 6,522 (6.7%)\n- 601398.SH ICBC: 300 @ 7.90 → 2,370 (2.4%)\n- 601288.SH AgBank: 200 @ 8.18 → 1,636 (1.7%)\n- 600031.SH Sany: 100 @ 22.50 → 2,250 (2.3%)\n- 601668.SH CSCEC: 200 @ 5.74 → 1,148 (1.2%)\n- 601728.SH China Telecom: 200 @ 6.89 → 1,378 (1.4%)\n- 600050.SH China Unicom: 400 @ 5.49 → 2,196 (2.2%)\n- 600028.SH Sinopec: 200 @ 5.58 → 1,116 (1.1%)\n- 601988.SH Bank of China: 400 @ 5.59 → 2,236 (2.3%)\n- 601658.SH PSBC: 200 @ 6.01 → 1,202 (1.2%)\n- Total equity value: ~84,284; Total portfolio value: ~97,877.\n\nSector snapshot (approx weights)\n- Financials (banks + Ping An): ~22%\n- Telecoms (Mobile + Unicom + Telecom): ~14.6%\n- Energy/Utilities (Shenhua + Sinopec + Yangtze Power): ~18.5%\n- Materials/Mining (Zijin): ~12.5%\n- Consumer staples (Yili): ~8.4%\n- Healthcare (Hengrui): ~6.7%\n- Industrials (Sany + CSCEC): ~3.5%\n- Cash: ~13.9%\n\nStep 5 — Today’s updated positions (post-trade)\n{'600519.SH': 0, '601318.SH': 100, '600036.SH': 200, '601899.SH': 400, '600900.SH': 300, '601166.SH': 0, '600276.SH': 100, '600030.SH': 0, '603259.SH': 0, '688981.SH': 0, '688256.SH': 0, '601398.SH': 300, '688041.SH': 0, '601211.SH': 0, '601288.SH': 200, '601328.SH': 0, '688008.SH': 0, '600887.SH': 300, '600150.SH': 0, '601816.SH': 0, '601127.SH': 0, '600031.SH': 100, '688012.SH': 0, '603501.SH': 0, '601088.SH': 200, '600309.SH': 0, '601601.SH': 0, '601668.SH': 200, '603993.SH': 0, '601012.SH': 0, '601728.SH': 200, '600690.SH': 0, '600809.SH': 0, '600941.SH': 100, '600406.SH': 0, '601857.SH': 0, '601766.SH': 0, '601919.SH': 0, '600050.SH': 400, '600760.SH': 0, '601225.SH': 0, '600028.SH': 200, '601988.SH': 400, '688111.SH': 0, '601985.SH': 0, '601888.SH': 0, '601628.SH': 0, '601600.SH': 0, '601658.SH': 200, '600048.SH': 0, 'CASH': 13593.0}\n\nNotes and next actions\n- The slight portfolio dip from yesterday is largely due to Hengrui and Zijin opening lower; telecoms were flat-to-slightly positive.\n- We hold elevated cash (~14%) to respond to earnings/macro as soon as reliable Q3 data can be fetched. Once the search tool stabilizes, we will reassess fundamentals (banks NIM/NPL trends, coal price trajectory, telco ARPU/5G monetization, staples volume/mix, pharma R&D and NRDL impacts) and redeploy cash as warranted.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
