I also ran market checks via search tools to inform positioning.\n\nMarket/context checks (via tools)\n- Macro risk-off: Headlines point to tariff-escalation fears weighing on A-shares; cyclicals under pressure, defensives preferred. Gold stronger vs. copper weaker in current macro setup. Semis/showed weakness today despite some “anti-cycle” narratives. Sources: Sina Finance, CME weekly metals note.\n- Company/sector snippets:\n  - Coal/power defensives: China Shenhua reported robust 9M25 profits (Everyday Economic News).\n  - Telcos: China Mobile management change with AI focus (Yicai).\n  - Pharma/biotech: Hengrui Q1–Q3 revenue and net profit both up (Securities Times). CRO names remain sensitive (WuXi AppTec headlines mixed).\n  - Staples: Yili Q1–Q3 net profit 104.26B RMB, mixed YoY metrics (Eastmoney).\n\nStep 1) Read input: yesterday’s positions and today’s prices\n- Positions as of yesterday’s close (shares): 601318.SH 100; 600036.SH 100; 600900.SH 100; 600276.SH 100; 603259.SH 100; 688981.SH 100; 600887.SH 100; 600031.SH 100; 600028.SH 100; CASH 49,449\n- Yesterday close vs. today buy price (for MTM):\n  - 601318.SH 中国平安: 55.54 -> 54.51 (-1.86%)\n  - 600036.SH 招商银行: 40.18 -> 39.76 (-1.05%)\n  - 600900.SH 长江电力: 27.73 -> 27.70 (-0.11%)\n  - 600276.SH 恒瑞医药: 68.20 -> 66.00 (-3.23%)\n  - 603259.SH 药明康德: 104.72 -> 98.00 (-6.42%)\n  - 688981.SH 中芯国际: 127.95 -> 126.00 (-1.52%)\n  - 600887.SH 伊利股份: 27.75 -> 27.53 (-0.79%)\n  - 600031.SH 三一重工: 22.96 -> 22.00 (-4.18%)\n  - 600028.SH 中国石化: 5.37 -> 5.30 (-1.30%)\n\nStep 2) Update valuation at today’s prices and portfolio weights\n- Position MTM values (shares x today price):\n  - 601318.SH: 5,451 (5.67% of portfolio)\n  - 600036.SH: 3,976 (4.13%)\n  - 600900.SH: 2,770 (2.88%)\n  - 600276.SH: 6,600 (6.87%)\n  - 603259.SH: 9,800 (10.19%)\n  - 688981.SH: 12,600 (13.10%)\n  - 600887.SH: 2,753 (2.86%)\n  - 600031.SH: 2,200 (2.29%)\n  - 600028.SH: 530 (0.55%)\n  - Cash: 49,449 (51.45%)\n- Totals:\n  - Equity value: 46,680\n  - Cash: 49,449\n  - Portfolio total: 96,129\n  - Day P/L on equities: 46,680 vs. 48,040 yesterday (-1,360; -2.83% on equities)\n  - Portfolio day move (incl. cash): -1.40%\n\nStep 3) Assessment and adjustment plan\n- Current stance: Very high cash (51%) helped cushion today’s drawdown. Growth/semis/CROs led declines; defensives (power/telecom/coal/gold miners) look relatively resilient given macro tone.\n- Risk control: Given the policy/geopolitical overhang and broad risk-off, avoid rushing to deploy all cash today. Prefer staged entries into defensives on weakness.\n- Target mix (near term): Cash 30–40%; defensives (telco, utilities, coal, gold miners) 35–45%; quality financials 10–15%; selective growth (pharma/semis) 10–15%.\n- Buy-on-weakness watchlist and indicative lots (all CN A-shares require multiples of 100 shares; not executing today, monitoring intraday/next sessions):\n  - 600941.SH 中国移动 (defensive yield + AI capex theme)\n  - 601088.SH 中国神华 (cash flow/yield hedge)\n  - 601899.SH 紫金矿业 (gold hedge; supportive macro)\n  - 601728.SH 中国电信 / 600050.SH 中国联通 (low beta defensives)\n  - 600406.SH 国电南瑞 (grid/digital power)\n- Trim/risk areas (if further drawdowns and thesis weakens): 603259.SH (CRO policy/US risk), 688981.SH (semis volatility) — maintain for now, but keep size in check.\n\nOperations today\n- No trades executed today. Positions unchanged; only valuation updated.\n- Rationale: Macro headline shock and negative breadth argue for patience and staggered deployment rather than immediate, large allocations. Will revisit buys if volatility subsides or at preset levels.\n\nUpdated positions (shares unchanged; cash unchanged)\n- 601318.SH: 100\n- 600036.SH: 100\n- 600900.SH: 100\n- 600276.SH: 100\n- 603259.SH: 100\n- 688981.SH: 100\n- 600887.SH: 100\n- 600031.SH: 100\n- 600028.SH: 100\n- CASH: 49,449\n\nIf you’d like, I can place staggered buy orders in 100-share lots for the defensive names above at specified limit prices. Otherwise, I’ll continue to monitor and update.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
