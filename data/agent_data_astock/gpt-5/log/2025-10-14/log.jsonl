Defensive, stable dividend; fundamentals steady.\n- 600276.SH 恒瑞医药: Media reports point to Q1–Q3 2025 net profit +~25% YoY; positive innovation pipeline momentum.\n- 688981.SH 中芯国际: Q1 2025 revenue +1.8% QoQ; guided Q2 revenue down 4–6% and margin 18–20%. Demand recovery uneven; watch utilization and pricing.\n- 603259.SH 药明康德: Recent announcements include shareholder agreement changes and stock asset disposals; recent volatility and regulatory sensitivity remain a risk factor.\n- 600031.SH 三一重工: Progress on H-share listing (A+H) could support long-term visibility; near-term still cyclical.\n- 600028.SH 中国石化: Sector research mixed; refining and chemicals margins sensitive to crude/product spreads; dividend supportive but cycle-dependent.\n- 601318.SH/600036.SH/600887.SH: Financials and staples remain valuation-driven; near-term data benign to mixed, long-term value intact.\n\nDecision and execution today\n- No trades executed today. Rationale: \n  - Signals mixed across cyclicals/semis; defensive names steady.\n  - Current cash buffer is high; however, execution tools showed inconsistent state in test calls, and to avoid operational risk, we maintain positions unchanged for today.\n  - We will revisit rebalancing with a focus on adding to high-conviction defensives/growth-at-reasonable-price (e.g., 600276, 600900, selective financials) and potentially trimming higher-risk CRO exposure (603259) when tool state is confirmed stable.\n- Important: For any A-share trades, we will adhere to the 100-share lot rule and T+1 settlement.\n\nCurrent portfolio after today’s mark (unchanged holdings, updated valuation)\n- Holdings (shares unchanged): 601318, 600036, 600900, 600276, 603259, 688981, 600887, 600031, 600028 all 100 shares each\n- Market value of equities: 48,498\n- Cash: 49,449\n- Total portfolio value: 97,947\n- Daily P/L: +302\n\nWatchlist and next-step plan (pending tool stability)\n- Consider trimming 603259.SH by 100 shares and reallocating into:\n  - 600276.SH +100 shares (Q1–Q3 2025 earnings momentum)\n  - 600900.SH +200 shares (defensive yield, steady hydrology)\n  - 601318.SH +100 shares (valuation support in insurance/financials)\n- Optional diversification: initiate 600941.SH 中国移动 (defensive dividend, telecom CAPEX cycle) in 100-share lots when price/yield attractive.\n- We will monitor intraday liquidity and execute in 100-share lots complying with A-share rules once trade tool state is verified.\n\nIf you’d like, I can proceed with the proposed rebalancing once the trading tool confirms the correct starting positions and cash.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
