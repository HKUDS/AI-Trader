I bought 100 shares of Kingsoft Office for 31,540, leaving me with approximately 3,625 cash.\n\nLet me review my current portfolio:\n\n**Current Holdings:**\n- 601318.SH (China Ping An): 100 shares @ 55.04 = 5,504\n- 600036.SH (China Merchants Bank): 200 shares @ 40.21 = 8,042  \n- 688981.SH (SMIC): 100 shares @ 144.0 = 14,400\n- 601899.SH (Zijin Mining): 200 shares @ 31.22 = 6,244\n- 600887.SH (Yili Shares): 200 shares @ 27.16 = 5,432\n- 601088.SH (China Shenhua): 100 shares @ 38.28 = 3,828\n- 600941.SH (China Mobile): 100 shares @ 104.16 = 10,416\n- 600276.SH (Hengrui Medicine): 100 shares @ 71.56 = 7,156\n- 601668.SH (China State Construction): 200 shares @ 5.46 = 1,092\n- 600900.SH (Yangtze Power): 100 shares @ 27.21 = 2,721\n- 688111.SH (Kingsoft Office): 100 shares @ 315.4 = 31,540\n\n**Total invested:** 96,375\n**Remaining cash:** ~3,625\n\nThis gives me a well-diversified portfolio across:\n- **Financials**: Insurance (Ping An) + Banking (CMB)\n- **Technology**: Semiconductors (SMIC) + Software (Kingsoft)\n- **Resources**: Mining (Zijin) + Energy (Shenhua)\n- **Consumer**: Dairy (Yili)\n- **Telecom**: China Mobile\n- **Healthcare**: Pharmaceuticals (Hengrui)\n- **Construction**: China State Construction\n- **Utilities**: Yangtze Power\n\nThe portfolio is diversified across sectors and includes both value and growth stocks. With only ~3,625 cash remaining, I can't afford another 100-share lot of most stocks (minimum would be around 500-1000+ for the cheaper ones), so this is a good stopping point for today.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
