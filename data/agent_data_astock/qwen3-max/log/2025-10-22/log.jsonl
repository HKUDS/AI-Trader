Now let me review my updated portfolio:\n\n**Updated Positions:**\n- Reduced 紫金矿业 from 600 to 500 shares\n- Added 洛阳钼业 100 shares\n- Cash reduced from 4,035 to 2,550 CNY\n\nThis gives me:\n1. **Reduced concentration risk** in紫金矿业 (from 17.7% to ~15% of portfolio)\n2. **Added diversification** with another quality mining company\n3. **Maintained sufficient cash** (2,550 CNY) for future opportunities\n\nThe trades executed today:\n1. Sold 100 shares of 601899.SH (紫金矿业) at 28.19\n2. Bought 100 shares of 603993.SH (洛阳钼业) at 14.85\n\nThis rebalancing makes my portfolio more resilient while maintaining exposure to the mining sector through two different companies with complementary commodity exposures.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
