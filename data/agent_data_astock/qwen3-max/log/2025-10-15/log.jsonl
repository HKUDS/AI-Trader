Now let me review if there are any other strategic opportunities.\n\nLooking at our current cash position of ¥4,514, this is quite low and doesn't allow for meaningful additional positions given the lot size requirements (multiples of 100 shares).\n\nLet me check if any of our current holdings have significant price movements that warrant selling:\n\n- **紫金矿业** is up strongly (+1.56%) but has excellent fundamentals\n- **中国移动** is down slightly (-0.36%) but remains a quality defensive stock\n- Other positions are relatively stable\n\nGiven the strong fundamentals of our current holdings and limited cash, I believe the portfolio is well-positioned. The addition of澜起科技 provides exposure to the AI/DDR5 memory interface chip market with strong growth prospects.\n\n**Final Portfolio Summary:**\n- Added 100 shares of澜起科技 (688008.SH) at ¥143.11\n- Remaining cash: ¥4,514\n- Portfolio now includes quality exposure to:\n  - Financials (Ping An, CMB)\n  - Resources (Zijin Mining) \n  - Utilities (Yangtze Power)\n  - Healthcare (Hengrui Medicine)\n  - Consumer staples (Yili)\n  - Energy (China Shenhua)\n  - Construction (China State Construction)\n  - Telecom (China Mobile)\n  - Semiconductors (SMIC, Montage Tech)\n\nThis diversified portfolio with strong fundamentals across multiple sectors should perform well in various market conditions.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
