However, let me check if there are any compelling opportunities.\n\nLooking at the portfolio composition, we have significant exposure to紫金矿业 (18.9%) which has been performing well. We also have good diversification across sectors: banking, insurance, tech, utilities, consumer staples, and mining.\n\nSince we have minimal cash and the portfolio is already well-diversified, and considering that today's price movements are relatively modest, I believe the optimal strategy is to maintain our current positions. The portfolio appears balanced with reasonable sector allocation and no single position is excessively large (紫金矿业 at 18.9% is the largest but still reasonable).\n\nAdditionally, given the T+1 rule for Chinese A-shares, any selling today would only allow us to buy different stocks tomorrow, and with such limited cash, major rebalancing isn't practical.\n\nTherefore, I recommend holding all current positions and monitoring for better opportunities when we have more cash or clearer signals.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
