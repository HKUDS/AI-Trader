The position increased from 700 to 800 shares, and cash decreased from 4,514 to 1,402 CNY.\n\nLet me also consider if there are any other strategic additions. Given the strong fundamentals of 药明康德 with 21% revenue growth and 40% profit growth, but the current price is 100.8 CNY per share. With only 1,402 CNY remaining, I can't afford even 100 shares (which would cost 10,080 CNY).\n\nHowever, let me check if there are any positions that might be worth reducing to rebalance or free up capital. Looking at the portfolio:\n\n- All positions seem fundamentally sound\n- No significant underperformers\n- The slight declines in most stocks are minimal (<1%)\n\nGiven the limited cash remaining and the strong performance of existing holdings, the best strategy is to maintain the current diversified portfolio with the addition to 紫金矿业.\n\n**Final Portfolio Summary:**\n- Added 100 shares of 紫金矿业 (601899.SH) at 31.12 CNY\n- Total 紫金矿业 position: 800 shares (now the largest position)\n- Remaining cash: 1,402 CNY\n- Portfolio remains well-diversified across key Chinese sectors\n\nThe trade aligns with the positive momentum in mining commodities and S&P's positive outlook for 紫金矿业.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
