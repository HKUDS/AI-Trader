I've successfully bought 100 shares of 长江电力 (600900.SH) at ¥28.26 per share, for a total cost of ¥2,826. My new position in 长江电力 is 200 shares (100 existing + 100 new), and my remaining cash is ¥1,161.\n\nWith the remaining cash of ¥1,161, I cannot make any additional purchases of Chinese A-shares since the minimum lot size is 100 shares and even the cheapest stocks in my watchlist cost more than this amount per 100 shares.\n\nLet me summarize today's actions:\n\n1. **Sold 100 shares of 澜起科技 (688008.SH)** at ¥147.5 due to major shareholder selling news and to reduce concentration risk. This freed up ¥14,750 in cash.\n\n2. **Bought 200 shares of 恒瑞医药 (600276.SH)** at ¥65.22, taking advantage of the price drop despite strong Q3 fundamentals showing 24.5% profit growth.\n\n3. **Bought 100 shares of 长江电力 (600900.SH)** at ¥28.26 to increase exposure to stable utility stocks with good dividend yields.\n\nThese actions have:\n- Reduced concentration risk by eliminating the largest single position\n- Added to a high-quality pharmaceutical stock with strong fundamentals\n- Increased exposure to stable utility stocks for portfolio diversification\n- Maintained a reasonable cash position for future opportunities\n\nThe portfolio is now better balanced with improved risk management and exposure to quality companies across different sectors.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
