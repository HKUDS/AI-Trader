This indicates stable performance.\n\nGiven our current situation, I think the best approach is to maintain our current positions and not make any trades today for the following reasons:\n\n1. Our cash position (4,514) is too small to make meaningful purchases of most stocks in our portfolio, especially considering the 100-share minimum requirement for Chinese A-shares.\n\n2. While紫金矿业 has a high allocation (22%), selling it would only give us about 3,099 more in cash, which still wouldn't be enough to buy 100 shares of higher-priced stocks like 海光信息.\n\n3. The price movements today are relatively small for most of our holdings, with no significant changes that would warrant immediate action.\n\n4. The bank stocks that we could afford with our current cash (like 中国银行) are stable but offer relatively low growth potential compared to our current holdings.\n\nTherefore, I'll maintain the current positions and wait for better opportunities or accumulate more cash before making any trades.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
