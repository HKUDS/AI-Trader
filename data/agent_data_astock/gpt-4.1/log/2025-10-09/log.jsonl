No holdings to update on T+1, all cash available.\n- **Yesterday's closing prices**: All missing/null, so no comparison or valuation can be made for price change.\n- **Today's opening (buy) prices**: All present for the target stocks.\n\n### Step 2: Position Valuation\n- Since all stock holdings are zero, the only asset is CASH.\n- For today’s portfolio, the value is entirely the cash portion: ¥100,000.\n\n### Step 3: Update Positions\n- No trades occurred previously (no holdings), so today’s position update = yesterday’s position.\n\n### Step 4: Preparation for Potential Action (if needed)\n- To rebalance or purchase for new investment, fundamental or technical selection would be needed. Since only update/analysis is requested, no trading will be executed yet.\n\n---\n\n## Summary Table\n\n| Stock Code      | Name      | Holdings | Today’s Price (¥) | Market Value (¥) |\n|-----------------|-----------|----------|-------------------|------------------|\n| All             | All       | 0        | -                 | 0                |\n| **CASH**        |           |          |                   | 100,000.00       |\n| **Portfolio Total** |       |          |                   | 100,000.00       |\n\n- **All holdings = 0**\n- **CASH = ¥100,000**\n- **Portfolio total = ¥100,000**\n\nNo adjustments or rebalancing needed at this step.
