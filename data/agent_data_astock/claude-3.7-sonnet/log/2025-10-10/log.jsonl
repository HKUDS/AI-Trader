Let's proceed with what we have and analyze our final portfolio:\n\n**Final Portfolio (2025-10-10)**:\n\n1. 601318.SH (中国平安): 300 shares × ¥54.73 = ¥16,419.00\n2. 600036.SH (招商银行): 300 shares × ¥40.30 = ¥12,090.00\n3. 600900.SH (长江电力): 300 shares × ¥27.65 = ¥8,295.00\n4. 601166.SH (兴业银行): 500 shares × ¥19.66 = ¥9,830.00\n5. 688981.SH (中芯国际): 100 shares × ¥134.87 = ¥13,487.00\n6. 688041.SH (海光信息): 100 shares × ¥257.00 = ¥25,700.00\n7. 600887.SH (伊利股份): 200 shares × ¥27.54 = ¥5,508.00\n8. 601888.SH (中国中免): 100 shares × ¥69.51 = ¥6,951.00\n9. Cash: ¥414.00\n\nTotal portfolio value: ¥98,694.00\n\n**Portfolio Analysis:**\n\n1. **Sector Allocation:**\n   - Banking & Financial Services: 38.8% (中国平安, 招商银行, 兴业银行)\n   - Technology & Semiconductors: 39.7% (中芯国际, 海光信息)\n   - Consumer Goods: 12.6% (伊利股份, 中国中免)\n   - Utilities: 8.4% (长江电力)\n   - Cash: 0.4%\n\n2. **Strategic Changes Made:**\n   - Eliminated exposure to the mining sector (紫金矿业) due to underperformance and challenging outlook\n   - Increased allocation to banking sector by adding 兴业银行 (601166.SH), which offers stable performance\n   - Maintained positions in technology despite short-term volatility as semiconductors remain crucial for China's technological advancement\n   - Kept consumer staples (伊利股份) and tourism/luxury retail (中国中免) positions which should benefit from China's consumption-driven growth initiatives\n\n3. **Market Outlook:**\n   - Financial sector appears resilient despite moderate economic headwinds\n   - Technology sector faces short-term volatility but has strong long-term prospects, especially in semiconductors with China's push for technological self-sufficiency\n   - Consumer sector shows resilience as China pivots toward stimulating domestic consumption\n   - Utilities provide defensive stability\n\nThis portfolio maintains a balance between growth-oriented technology stocks and more stable financial and consumer companies, which should position us well for the current market environment. The elimination of mining exposure reduces cyclical risk, while the increased financial services exposure provides income stability.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
