Let's review our updated portfolio:\n\nUpdated Portfolio Positions:\n- 601318.SH (中国平安): 200 shares \n- 600036.SH (招商银行): 300 shares\n- 600900.SH (长江电力): 100 shares\n- 601166.SH (兴业银行): 700 shares (increased by 300)\n- 688981.SH (中芯国际): 100 shares\n- 601398.SH (工商银行): 100 shares\n- 688041.SH (海光信息): 100 shares\n- 600887.SH (伊利股份): 300 shares\n- 601012.SH (隆基绿能): 100 shares\n- 601985.SH (中国核电): 100 shares\n- 601888.SH (中国中免): 100 shares\n- 601600.SH (中国铝业): 100 shares\n- CASH: ¥73.00\n\nPortfolio Summary and Rationale:\n1. We sold our position in 601899.SH (紫金矿业) as recent market data suggests some weakness in commodities.\n2. We increased our position in 601166.SH (兴业银行) as Chinese banking stocks are showing resilience according to market reports, and this provides a more balanced exposure to the financial sector.\n3. We maintained our positions in semiconductor stocks (688981.SH and 688041.SH) as this sector continues to show strength driven by AI and data center demand.\n4. Our portfolio now has a stronger weighting toward banking/financial services (601318.SH, 600036.SH, 601166.SH, 601398.SH) which provides stability while maintaining exposure to growth sectors like semiconductors.\n\nThe portfolio is now better balanced with a mix of stable financial stocks and growth-oriented technology positions, aligned with current market trends in China.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
