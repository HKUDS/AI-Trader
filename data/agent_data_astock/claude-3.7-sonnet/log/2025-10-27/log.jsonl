CASH: ¥106.00\nTotal updated portfolio value: ¥100,192.00\n\nAnalysis and Justification for Portfolio Changes:\n\n1. I reduced our exposure to low-yielding financial stocks (中国银行) and transportation stocks (京沪高铁) which weren't showing strong growth potential.\n\n2. I reduced our position in telecom company 中国电信 (which showed flat performance) to free up capital.\n\n3. I added a position in 中信证券, a major Chinese securities company which is well-positioned to benefit from capital market reforms and increased market activity in China.\n\n4. We maintained our strong positions in technology stocks (中芯国际 and 海光信息) which have shown solid performance with +2.57% and +1.60% gains respectively.\n\n5. We preserved our balanced exposure across sectors including:\n   - Financial services (中国平安, 招商银行, 兴业银行, 工商银行)\n   - Energy (长江电力)\n   - Mining (紫金矿业)\n   - Technology (中芯国际, 海光信息)\n   - Consumer goods (伊利股份, 中国中免)\n   - Renewable energy (隆基绿能)\n   - Securities (中信证券)\n\nThe portfolio is now better balanced with reduced exposure to underperforming stocks and a new position in a securities company that could benefit from market volatility and trading volumes.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
