This allocation provides:\n\n1. Exposure to high-growth technology sector, particularly semiconductors which have been outperforming\n2. Stability through financial companies\n3. Consumer exposure for defensive positioning\n4. Commodities and utilities for diversification\n\nThis represents a balanced approach with a slight overweight toward technology given the strong performance of Chinese tech stocks in 2025 as noted in our research. The portfolio is well-positioned to benefit from China's continued technological advancement while maintaining exposure to more traditional sectors.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
